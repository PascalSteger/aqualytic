Project Aqualytic TODOs
==================

* DONE download runoff data
* DONE convert data to csv
* DONE read in data
* DONE set up all variables
* DONE set up easy forecasting using previous year's data copied over
* DONE forecast in log space, averaging
* DONE forecast in lin space, averaging with moving window, exponentially decaying window
* DONE forecast in log space, averaging with moving window, exponentially decaying window
* WAITING forecast with Fourier decomposition                       :WAITING:
  - State "WAITING"    from "TODO"       [2014-10-11 Sat 20:55] \\
    for rfftw and irfftw documentation on averaging, exclusion of higher order wiggles
* TODO forecast with MCMC to sample parameter space = modes of Fourier transformation
* DONE write down differential equation for water reservoir
* DONE implement spline fitting based on last N entries
  - State "DONE"       from "HOLD"       [2014-10-11 Sat 17:26]
  - State "HOLD"       from "TODO"       [2014-10-11 Sat 13:55] \\
    revert knowBase code part
* TODO solve PDE system
* DONE set up Neural Network with 2 layers to learn influence of snow height on peak height later on
** DONE download pybrain, compile it
* TODO use all information from all rivers to restrict it
* TODO handle NaN in Neural Network
** TODO first guess: fill in data from archival (or long-term average) values.
